# Metroid NES Recreation
This project is a recreation of the first area, Brinstar, in the NES classic Metroid.
While all features and enemies have been recreated, they have not been positioned around the map as they were in the original.
They are however all present near the starting area, which makes for a hectic showcase of all features implemented.

This project was made in 2022 for the course Programming 2 while studying Game Development at Howest.
